# Jtrix

## Environment Setup
Ocaml and LLVM are required to use the Jtrix compiler. Specifically, Ocaml version 4.05 and LLVM version 7.

## About the Language
Although other languages, like Haskell, have matrix operations/maniplations in their libraries, the languages themselves are often hard to grasp. Jtrix was designed to be easier for the end user to use while still maintaining some power in its matrix manipulations.
